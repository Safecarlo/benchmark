* Tools

  - verificarlo
  - make
  - gnuplot

* Usage
** Downloading

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Safecarlo/benchmark.git
$ cd benchmark
#+END_SRC

** Run on master branch

   You must ensure that you have the Verificarlo version on *master branch*.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./run.sh [CORE ID]
$ ./prefix.sh serial
#+END_SRC

** Run on vector branch

   You must ensure that you have the Verificarlo version on *vectorisation
   branch in Safecarlo*.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./run.sh [CORE ID]
$ ./prefix.sh vector
#+END_SRC

** Run on vector branch with serial implementaion of normal

   It will run all test, that is for *ieee* and *vprec* with *normal* and
   *denormal* numbers. But we just need the result of *vprec* with *normal*
   numbers.
   
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ ./run.sh [CORE ID]
  $ rm -Rf ieee.txt
  $ rm -Rf vprec_denormal.txt
  $ mv vprec_normal.txt nomral_serial_vprec_normal.txt
#+END_SRC

** Speedup

   Now you can compute speedup between *master branch* and *vector branch*. Note
   that *master branch* is taken as baseline (except for the difference in
   serial and vector normal difference in vprec).

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./speedup.sh
#+END_SRC

** Plotting

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ gnuplot plot.gp
#+END_SRC

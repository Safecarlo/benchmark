* Tools

  - verificarlo
  - make
  - gnuplot

* Usage
** Downloading

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Safecarlo/benchmark.git
$ cd benchmark
#+END_SRC

** Run on master branch

   You must ensure that you have the Verificarlo version on *master branch*.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./run.sh [CORE ID]
$ ./prefix.sh serial
#+END_SRC

** Run on vector branch

   You must ensure that you have the Verificarlo version on *vectorisation
   branch in Safecarlo*.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./run.sh [CORE ID]
$ ./prefix.sh vector
#+END_SRC

** Speedup

   Now you can compute speedup between *serial* version and *vector*
   version. Note that *serial* vesion is taken as baseline.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ ./speedup.sh
#+END_SRC

** Plotting

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ gnuplot plot.gp
#+END_SRC
